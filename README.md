Currently, I am working on creating a Telegram bot that 1) receives and forwards service requests from customers, 2) provides current exchange rates upon request from the Central Bank of Russia, the National Bank of Kazakhstan, MOEX and KASE exchanges, as well as data from the most popular banks in Kazakhstan: Freedom Bank, Halyk Bank, Bank Center Credit, and others.
